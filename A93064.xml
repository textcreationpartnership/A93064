            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:170559:5"/>
declaimed against the ſame, with moſt Solid Arguments; and Pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Expreſſions; in which anſwer he did ſo bespatter the white Robes of your <hi>Royall Fathers</hi> ſpotleſs life, (humane infirmities excepted) with the dirty filth of his ſatyricall pen, that to the vulgar, and thoſe who read his book with prejudice, he repreſented him, a moſt debauched vitious man, (I tremble <hi>Royall Sir</hi> to write it,) an irrelegious hater, and perſecutor of Religion, and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, an ambitious inſlaver of the <hi>Nation,</hi> a bloudy <hi>Tyrant,</hi> and an inplacable Enemy to all his good <hi>Subjects,</hi> and thereupon calls that execrable, and deteſtable horrible <hi>Murther</hi> a juſt execution, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends it as an Heroick Action, and
<pb facs="tcp:170559:6"/>
in a word, whatever was done in proſecution of their malice toward your <hi>Royall Progenitor,</hi> and his Iſſue, or <hi>Relations,</hi> or <hi>Friends,</hi> and aſiſtants, he calls reſtoring the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to its Liberty. Yea to make your <hi>illuſtrious Father</hi> more odious in their eyes, where he by any means could fixe his ſcandals he would not ſpare that incomparable piece of his writing, (his <gap reason="foreign">

               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:170559:27"/>
but as an <hi>Orator</hi> intending to inquire into the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> of things, and not to determine how the Caſe ſtands in point of Law.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>Lords</hi> had been <hi>uſeleſſe</hi> and <hi>unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> to ſit as a <hi>Houſe,</hi> and aſſiſt in <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> yet they were <hi>abſolutely</hi> of uſe, to the making of an <hi>Engliſh Parliament;</hi> or elſe ſhew me any Parliament that ever was in <hi>England</hi> without them. You confeſſe that the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was aſſiſted by a great number of <hi>faithfull Adherers</hi> to them, in the defenſe of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Civil Liberties,</hi> and were not they as well the <hi>Peers</hi> as the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons?</hi> By what Power were <hi>Armies</hi> firſt raiſed, <hi>Commiſſions</hi> granted, and <hi>Moneys</hi> levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but in the name of <hi>both Houſes?</hi> If the firſt making of Warre, (which judicious and conſcientious men judge <hi>Rebellion,</hi> but I ſhall wave that Enquiry, nor hereafter meddle with it) were for the defence of <hi>Religion,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>Lords</hi> as an <hi>Houſe</hi> can claim as great a ſhare in the glory of it, as the <hi>Houſe of Commons.</hi> Yea if to have the honour of firſt kindling the fire, deſerve prayſe, <hi>One Peer,</hi> with <hi>Five Commoners,</hi> muſt ſhare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Was not the caſe of <hi>Kimbolton</hi> once accounted of as high merit as that of <hi>Hoſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rig</hi> and his fellow-partners?

               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:170559:27"/>
of <hi>Parliament</hi> equally pretended to be concerned in the defending of them all? Or if the <hi>management</hi> of the <hi>Warre,</hi> deſerve commendation, (which you call <hi>the aſſiſtance of the Faithfull)</hi> did not the <hi>Lords</hi> perſonally act as highly, and adventure as far as any <hi>Commoner?</hi> Or did not the <hi>faithfulleſt,</hi> (for I obſerve you uſe the Superlative degree) appear before the <hi>new modelling</hi> of the <hi>Army?</hi> True, there was no <hi>rebelling</hi> againſt all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, <hi>King, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> at once, till that time.

You muſt needs grant, that the <hi>Warre</hi> at the beginning was <hi>raiſed,</hi> and from the firſt <hi>carryed</hi> on, for the <hi>defenſe</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> or elſe it was moſt <hi>hypocriticall</hi> and <hi>barbarous Rebellion,</hi> and all the <hi>bloud</hi> ſhed therein <hi>inexcuſable murder:</hi> And if it were for the <hi>defenſe</hi> of <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> from the beginning, without doubt every rationall man muſt conceive, that they who at firſt <hi>acted</hi> themſelves in the War

               <hi>vigorouſly,</hi> and ſtirred up others to it <hi>ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly,</hi> and continued <hi>conſtantly,</hi> in the name of the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of <hi>both Houſes,</hi> did never imagine the <hi>Commons</hi> alone to be a <hi>Parliament.</hi>

            <p>So that in truth, it was not only not the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that did it, but neither the <hi>Lords</hi> nor <hi>Commons</hi> Houſe that either <hi>acted</hi> in, or <hi>conſented</hi> to it, but a <hi>factious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination</hi> of ſome of the <hi>rotten Members</hi> of the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons,</hi> who <hi>aſſiſted</hi> by the <hi>factious</hi> and <hi>rebellious</hi> part of the <hi>Souldiery,</hi> without <hi>conſent</hi> of, and in <hi>oppoſition</hi> to their <hi>Fellow-members,</hi> contrary to the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the whole <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi> not minding their former <hi>ſacred Vowes,</hi> and the ſcandall which the breaking of them would bring upon the <hi>profeſſion</hi> of <hi>Religion; murdered</hi> their <hi>KING,</hi> divided his <hi>Eſtate</hi> and <hi>Revenue,</hi> among themſelves, and their Abettors: and to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themſelves from <hi>juſtice,</hi> for theſe <hi>Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Villanies,</hi> Vote down both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingly Government,</hi> turn out of dores the

            <p>'Tis ſtrange, that if it were ſo, and that thoſe <hi>Remnant</hi> of <hi>Patriots,</hi> who <hi>delivered</hi> us from <hi>thralldome</hi> (as you are pleaſed to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call them) could no otherwiſe ſecure us from <hi>ſlavery</hi> and <hi>bondage,</hi> but by <hi>aboliſhing Kingſhip,</hi> that no more of the <hi>Commons</hi> nor any of the <hi>Lords Houſe,</hi> could <hi>perceive</hi> it but themſelves.

Now to imagine that monys voluntarily given, ſhould be extorted, and where the queſtion is put and each man without compaſſion hath liberty of giving his Ay or No, without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rendring an account of the reaſon of his

            <p>To this I know what you would reply, namely, That the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> had within its Walls a <hi>Court faction,</hi> and without, both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Lords,</hi> (who were his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) and all labouring to their utmoſt, to <hi>ſupplant</hi> the <hi>ſincere</hi> part of the <hi>Commons,</hi> who were <hi>zealous</hi> in <hi>defenſe</hi> of the <hi>Peoples Liberty.</hi> This Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> is ſoon ſaid, and <hi>Machiavell</hi> teacheth you no leſſe, but not ſo eaſily to be admitted: The <hi>Commons</hi> are choſen by the <hi>Counties, Cities</hi> and <hi>Burroughs,</hi> for which they ſerve, who uſually chooſe ſuch whom they moſt confide in, to the <hi>Electors</hi> they are ingaged by <hi>Indenture,</hi> or <hi>Covenant,</hi> and ſo where a <hi>Free Choyce</hi> is, there is leſs fear, that men <hi>choſen</hi> by all, <hi>impowered</hi> by all, and <hi>repreſenting</hi> all, and willingly <hi>ingaging</hi> their

We know, Mr. <hi>Milton,</hi> that <hi>Elections</hi> then were <hi>Free,</hi> and no <hi>Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition</hi> laid upon any that were by <hi>Law</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, either from <hi>Electing</hi> or being <hi>Elected.</hi> True, ſince our <hi>Yoak</hi> (as you term it) hath been ſhook off, and none are under re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, but only ſuch who fear an <hi>Oath,</hi> and make Conſcience to keep thoſe <hi>ſacred tyes</hi> inviolable, which <hi>judicially</hi> and <hi>conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiouſly</hi> they took, we have had at leaſt <hi>nine</hi> parts of <hi>ten</hi> reſtrained from either chooſing or being choſen, ſo that the <hi>tenth</hi> part only hath had liberty of <hi>Ordering</hi> the <hi>Election,</hi> and the other <hi>nine</hi> parts, muſt upon penalty of being <hi>plundred,</hi> ſit ſtill, and call this a <hi>Free Parliament,</hi> in ſuch a <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons,</hi> as this I doubt not but many may be found, who will <hi>betray their Truſt,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be committed to them, becauſe they indeed are not <hi>Elected</hi> by, but <hi>Obtruded</hi> upon the people: Thus we have had not only <hi>Knights,</hi> but alſo <hi>Citizens,</hi> and <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes,</hi> more then <hi>formally</hi> yea <hi>really,</hi> men <hi>(cum accinctis Gladiis)</hi> with their <hi>Swords</hi> girt, for <hi>Army Officers</hi> have not ſeldome

            </p>
            <p>But if really theſe men had (as you ſay) <hi>experimentally</hi> found, and that upon long <hi>proof, Kingly Government</hi> to be <hi>expenſive</hi> and <hi>burdenſome,</hi> what can they <hi>pretend</hi> in <hi>excuſe,</hi> that they ſhould Declare publiquely their intent to be, to make this <hi>Kings Rvenue</hi> Larger and more Splendid? Was this intent <hi>reall,</hi> or did they make uſe of it as a <hi>decoy pretenſe</hi> to ingage the <hi>Common people</hi> of their ſide, without whom they could not perform their work? Yea I will appeal only to themſelves, had they not <hi>declared, proteſted, covenanted, vowed,</hi> and uſed all <hi>ſacred</hi> and <hi>ſolemn means,</hi> to perſwade the <hi>Nation,</hi> that their <hi>reall intent</hi> was only to <hi>remove</hi> ſome <hi>bad Counſellors</hi> from about the <hi>King,</hi> and to bring them to <hi>Juſtice,</hi> but that to his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties</hi> Perſon, and <hi>Royall Iſſue,</hi> they bore <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>inviolable Allegiance,</hi> nor ever minded to <hi>abridge</hi> his <hi>just Prerogative,</hi> only with it to <hi>confirm</hi> and <hi>ſecure,</hi> and <hi>ſettle</hi> the <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Priviledge</hi> of the <hi>Subject,</hi> if (I ſay) they had not Declared this, do they think that ever <hi>Money</hi> had been lent and raiſed, or ſo many men would have ingaged their <hi>Lives</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:170559:44"/>
and <hi>Fortunes?</hi> No verily, thoſe <hi>turbulent ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> (without theſe <hi>ſpecious ſhewes)</hi> had been left at firſt, ſtript of all <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Abettors,</hi> to the hand of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> to have had their <hi>hot ſpirits</hi> cooled with <hi>deſerved Impriſonment,</hi> or perhaps with a <hi>Hempen Preſervative,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>future infection</hi> with a <hi>treaſonable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well then, if the People by ſuch <hi>pretences</hi> were cheated into a <hi>Rebellious War,</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo much be imputed to them, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, what the <hi>Parliament</hi> with <hi>ſacred ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity vowed</hi> and <hi>ſwore,</hi> (enough to induce any, but very <hi>diſcerning Judgements,</hi> to ſide with them) but the blame muſt for ever lie at their dores, who have acted ſo <hi>rebelliouſly</hi> and <hi>perfidiouſly</hi> on one hand, and <hi>diſſemblingly</hi> on the other.</p>
            <p>Conſider I pray you things upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> for Sir, there is Juſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Thieves and High-way men, if they ſhare their Booty fairly and equally: could theſe <hi>Patriots,</hi> as you call them, of our <hi>liberty,</hi> (the <hi>Rumpers</hi> I mean) with their own valour and wit, upon their own Charges, have defeated the <hi>King,</hi> and all who ſhould appear for him, upon the ſcore of the expenſiveneſs, burdenſomeneſſe, uſeleſneſſe and dangerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his Office, and publiquely avowed

            <p>But Sir whatever you have ſaid as to this Argument, I ſhall have occaſion to meet with and ſpeak to in proving my own aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and therefore I ſhall with as much bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, as perſpicuity will admit diſcourſe of, and by ſolid reaſons confirm the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kingſhip</hi> I affirm, to be the only <hi>deſirable</hi> government in the world, and of all ſorts of <hi>Kingly Governments</hi> or <hi>Monarchies,</hi> ours of <hi>England</hi> was moſt <hi>exquiſitely compoſed, equally tempered,</hi> and <hi>ſuited</hi> to a <hi>Nation</hi> really free, and yet <hi>truly Subject,</hi> where <hi>Majeſty</hi> and <hi>ſubjection</hi> made a true harmony, and the moſt inferiour
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170559:45"/>
members were as equally neceſſary to the good of the whole, as the chief. In it the <hi>King</hi> was <hi>Supreme,</hi> the head of Law and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and yet himſelf never had power to make, or to execute any Law, the <hi>governed people</hi> propounded, formed, and modelled, ſuch Lawes by which they were to be ruled, The <hi>peers</hi> who alſo had a ſhare in ſubjection, yet a degree advanced above the <hi>Commons,</hi> they had likewiſe a hand in Laws; that were to be enacted, to whom therefore they were brought for <hi>approbation.</hi> And being thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and approved, they were laſtly preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>King</hi> for his <hi>Royall confirmation.</hi> Thus the Commons <hi>propounding,</hi> and <hi>framing</hi> the nobles <hi>approving</hi> and <hi>Conſenting,</hi> the King <hi>ſigning</hi> and <hi>confirming,</hi> Lawes were made. Where now is flavery? where the bondage, and vaſſallage, which you made ſo great a noyſe concerning? Was it in having any Laws at all? Truely Mr <hi>Milton,</hi> however you palliate things I believe verily there lyes the knot that troubles you, there your ſhooe pinches. I find generally ſuch <hi>Chriſtian Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> as your writings ſhew you to be one of, come at laſt to throw off all externall coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive, or binding lawes, and deſire only to be governed by the Law <hi>within</hi> them, which in truth is a <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>Lawleſneſſe.</hi> To this your
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170559:46"/>
doctrine of divorce ſeems to incline, therein you complain much of bondage, and thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, vaſſalage, and what not, only for ſtanding indiſpenſably obliged to your wife, after the Covenant of God mutually paſſed between you, what wonder then, if you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it vaſſallage to be held by an <hi>Oath of Allegiance?</hi> But as there have been, and are many who account themſelves at a much greater liberty, being engaged in an invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable bond, to a loving wife, (&amp; conſidering the frailty of their nature, cannot abide a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle life) ſo I queſtion not but thouſands of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſpirits, Judged themſelves farre more free, when we had our <hi>KING,</hi> and kept our <hi>Oaths</hi> by which we were indiſpenſably inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to him <hi>Conſcientiouſly</hi> and <hi>firmly,</hi> then ſince, by <hi>Hypocriſie, Perjury,</hi> and <hi>Rebellion,</hi> we have gained this (much talked of) <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to our former, and not by humane Art amendable form of Government if you will yeild it convenient to have any Laws, what can be better then thoſe of the <hi>Peoples own making,</hi> they propounded, they framed them, unleſs you would have their <hi>Reſolves</hi> to be <hi>Laws,</hi> without any <hi>Concurrence of Nobles,</hi> or <hi>Conſent</hi> of the <hi>KING?</hi> If ſo, what monſtrous Liberty would you have,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170559:46"/>
when virtually two thirds of the Nation muſt be content, with what the <hi>Commons</hi> do, or as the Proverb is <hi>turn the buckle of their girdle behind them, and ſeek their amends where they can get them?</hi> The <hi>KING</hi> his <hi>Family</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity,</hi> had a <hi>Revenue</hi> of their own for which he was not engaged to the preſent people. He had lands by due title as any <hi>Commoner</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and was ſuable in caſe he detained any mans Land, or other of his eſtate illegal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the Law equally free againſt, as for the <hi>King,</hi> Now the <hi>Royalties</hi> which belonged to him (as ſupream) <hi>viz.

            </p>
            <p>The people of <hi>England,</hi> as they had <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> which were their birthright and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to them, ſo alſo had the <hi>King</hi> as one of the Nation, for his being <hi>King,</hi> and ſo <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme</hi> although it added much to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond other men, yet it abridged him of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that was his, as a man, It was right the <hi>King</hi> ſhould have <hi>Liberty,</hi> in his <hi>Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> of what the <hi>Peers,</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, for his <hi>Royall aſcent,</hi> or elſe they might, if ever both eſtates could agree, at their pleaſure, <hi>dethrone</hi> him, or <hi>limit,</hi> or <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> his <hi>ſucceſſors,</hi> or what not injurious to him

as a <hi>man,</hi> but much more as a <hi>King?</hi> So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the <hi>Nobles</hi> of the Land, how ſhould they be repreſented? Barely to be choſen among the <hi>Commoners?</hi> If ſo what inconvenience of neceſſity muſt thence ariſe, and how abſurd it would be, a ſhallow diſcretion might eaſily apprehend, for firſt they exceeding (for the Generallity) the Commons in eſtate, would be much more popular, and ſo, if they could be courted ſo farre out of their honour, as to accept of popular elections, what <hi>Parliament</hi> could we expect but the majority of them would be Nobles, and by this means they which in our preſent conſtitution, are only <hi>reviſers,</hi> and <hi>approvers</hi> of the <hi>Laws</hi> would ſoon become the <hi>Law-framers,</hi> and <hi>Enactors.</hi> Or if you ſhould imagine that few only of them would be choſen, as of late, two of the houſe of <hi>Peers</hi> were <hi>Rumpers,</hi> what ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality and abſurdity would there be, when a ſmall <hi>Borough</hi> ſhall elect <hi>two Burgeſſes,</hi> and he who is <hi>Lord</hi> perhaps of twenty or more <hi>Burroughs,</hi> and the chief man in three or four <hi>Counties</hi> as to eſtate, ſhall only be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by his own ſingle <hi>voice,</hi> and ſome not at all?

               <hi>Marriage,</hi> needed your <hi>Divinity</hi> to <hi>explain</hi> and <hi>limit</hi> it: and as by the latter you gained lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle credit among the <hi>Ladyes</hi> or <hi>ſuch prudent ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber men</hi> who made a Conſcience of their <hi>Vow</hi> in <hi>Marriage,</hi> ſo the former is leſſe accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to true <hi>loyall breaſts,</hi> and will be exibila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the vulgar, when once the fury of our former madneſs is a little allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Twas ſtrange that you could imagine no ſubordinate <hi>ingagement</hi> to a ſingle <hi>perſon,</hi> but what is accompanyed with <hi>Vaſſalage,</hi> when it is certain in faith, that among the three perſons, <hi>Chriſt the Sonne,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> who are God bleſſed for evermore, are both <hi>Subordinately</hi> related as <hi>Perſons</hi> to the <hi>Father,</hi> and yet there is that bleſſed freedome and Liberty, that among them is <hi>unity.</hi> But we will come to humane Governments, for concerning them will lye the queſtion, In ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety the firſt <hi>ſubordination</hi> is <hi>aeconomical</hi> of <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> to <hi>Parents,</hi> and for to provide the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a mans family, and to carry on things more comfortably, comes in another rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of <hi>ſervant</hi> and <hi>Maſter.</hi> Now although the <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Wife</hi> be head of the family, yet not <hi>ſeparately</hi> but <hi>unitedly,</hi> and the <hi>Wife</hi> her ſelf is <hi>ſuborainate,</hi> being above all the reſt, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>inferiour</hi> to her <hi>husband,</hi> although in ſome

and judging them, who was known from <hi>Dan</hi> unto <hi>Beerſheba</hi> to be a Prophet of the Lord, and to have frequent <hi>Dialogues</hi> with his <hi>Maker.</hi> This was their ſin, and God to convince them of it, gave them their deſire, a <hi>King</hi> in his <hi>wrath,</hi> whom he after <hi>took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> in his <hi>diſpleaſure.</hi>

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170559:52"/>
to <hi>Jacob,</hi> and by him (being Divinely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected) it was intayled upon <hi>Judah</hi> and his <hi>Offspring,</hi> over all their <hi>brethren,</hi> untill the coming of <hi>Shiloh,</hi> which Promiſe was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſht (with the bleſſing thereof) in the <hi>Anoynting</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> eſpecially when he was confirmed <hi>King,</hi> over all <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During which interval of time, for the ſpace of four hundred and thirty years they were Sojourners, and in Bondage, in <hi>Egypt.</hi> But when the time of <hi>deliverance</hi> came, God ſent them a <hi>Captain,</hi> and a <hi>Redeemer,</hi> even <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was a <hi>Prince</hi> in <hi>Jeſhuron,</hi> or <hi>Iſrael,</hi> concerning whom God ſaid, <hi>That Aaron ſhould be unto him as a Mouth, and he ſhould be unto the people as</hi> (or in the ſtead of) <hi>God.</hi> What was this, but a <hi>KING,</hi> or <hi>Chief Ruler</hi> or <hi>Judge,</hi> as <hi>Stephen</hi> expounds it in the Acts, <hi>This Moſes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whom they refuſed, ſaying, Who made thee a Judge, or Ruler over us, the ſame did God ſend to be a Ruler and Deliverer.</hi> He under God imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, conducted, gave Lawes to, yea he judged and determined Controverſies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.

               <hi>judge</hi> between them, to hear and determine their <hi>Controverſies:</hi> with a Reſerve ſtill, or an <hi>Alwayes provided</hi> (as our <hi>Lawes</hi> have it) that the greater, and more difficult, and weighty matters be brought unto <hi>Moſes;</hi> by which it appears, that he under God was their <hi>Supreme Judge, Captain, Leader</hi> and <hi>Conducter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After <hi>Moſes</hi> death, <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſucceds him, of whom firſt it is teſtified, <hi>that the Spirit of</hi> Moſes <hi>reſted upon him,</hi> that is, he was the Peoples <hi>Chief Captain,</hi> and <hi>Judge,</hi> though the <hi>Sanedrim</hi> ſtill continued, for that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained an Ordinance in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> till the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> (although perhaps with ſome variation) yea it is further added, <hi>that the Lord promiſed to be,</hi> and was, <hi>with him,</hi> as he was with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the people <hi>obeyed</hi> him, as they did <hi>Moſes.</hi> I dare ſay, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that no <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England</hi> ever did aſſume, nor any would hereafter deſire a larger extent of <hi>Authority,</hi> over <hi>Subjects,</hi> then <hi>Joſhuah</hi> had and exerciſed over <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſucceed the <hi>Judges,</hi> who all of them exerciſed the <hi>authority</hi> (although they wanted the <hi>title</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> yet one of the Sons of <hi>Gideon, Abimelech,</hi> born of a Concubine, had both the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>title</hi> of a <hi>King,</hi> and was a <hi>Tyrant;</hi> yet was he none, to

whom, and in whom the promiſe of bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was made, which was not accompliſhed till <hi>Davids</hi> time.</p>
            <p>Adde to this, that the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was never <hi>compleat</hi> but under <hi>Kingly Government,</hi> no nor till the promiſed <hi>Kingly ſtock</hi> came. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they were ſold now to this <hi>heathen</hi> King, now to that, <hi>oppreſſed, burdened,</hi> and <hi>afflicted;</hi> yea, and in the time of <hi>Saul,</hi> the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> oppreſſed <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſorely, inſomuch, that you ſhall finde <hi>Saul</hi> with a ſlender Army, and them following him trembling, on the other hand, the inſulting <hi>Philiſtims</hi> reproaching them, when they ſaw any of them to appear, Theſe <hi>Hebrews</hi> come out of their holes into which they were crept to hide themſelves: Untill <hi>David,</hi> the <hi>Choſen</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> comes to ſit upon the <hi>throne,</hi> and to have the <hi>Kingdom</hi> eſtabliſhed unto him over all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as well as <hi>Judah,</hi> then he fights the Battles of the Lord, and God gives him Victory on every ſide, untill the name of <hi>Jacob</hi> became fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous among the Nations.</p>
            <p>And it is worth obſervation, that after the death of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and the <hi>Elders</hi> who out-lived <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> who had ſeen Gods great works, no <hi>Ruler</hi> being then in Chief, the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ask counſel of God, who ſhall go up firſt to battell, and God gives
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170559:53"/>
anſwer, <hi>Judah</hi> ſhall go up firſt. Now the <hi>Sanedrim</hi> or <hi>Common-wealth</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> had a time to be tryed, how good a <hi>Government</hi> that was, yet then you ſhall finde, the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> making peace with the Nations about them, contrary to the expreſs command of God, by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely injoyned, and often reiterated: Then comes the Angel with that ſad meſſage, which made them lift up their voyce and weep, ſo remarkably that the place from it took the name of <hi>Bochim,</hi> or <hi>place</hi> of <hi>weeping.</hi> Then was that praevarication of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not to be expiated but by reiterated, and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſervitudes, under <hi>Heathen,</hi> neighbouring <hi>Princes,</hi> whom they forbore to extirpate, according to the Command of God. Then comes the time of which the Holy Ghoſt teſtifies <hi>that there was no King in Iſrael, and every one did that which was right in his own eyes,</hi> This was the <hi>Interſtitium</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> (that of the bare <hi>Sanedrim</hi> or <hi>Seventy Elders,</hi> being reputed by God as none at all) in which the <hi>Levites Concubine</hi> was, with unheard of brutiſh inhumanity, raviſhed to death, which barbarous abominable action was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged, with almoſt the whole extirpation of one great Tribe in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to wit <hi>Benjamin,</hi> forty thouſand ſtout men, being loſt in two

preceding Battels, on the part of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven other Tribes, and after this, the <hi>Jabeſh-Gileadites</hi> utterly cut off (all the males to wit, and married women) becauſe they were <hi>Anathematized</hi> by a <hi>Solemn Vow</hi> of the Congregation, for not appearing before the Lord in <hi>Mizpeh,</hi> in revenge of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable Rape upon the Tribe of <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which it is evident, that the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>Moſes, Joſhua,</hi> and the <hi>Judges</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted by God as <hi>Kingſhip,</hi> and the want thereof, is by Divine inſpiration reputed as a <hi>total defect</hi> of <hi>Government. There was no King in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>therefore every man did what was good in his own eyes:</hi> Yet at that time it is evident, (by the ſame ſacred authority) that there were <hi>Elders</hi> of the <hi>Congregation,</hi> otherwiſe called the <hi>Chief</hi> of the <hi>Tribes,</hi> who conſulted upon this act, (of thoſe of <hi>Gibeah)</hi> committed againſt the <hi>Levite,</hi> upon his Concubine, and who, upon the <hi>Benjamites</hi> appearing armed to defend the fact, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged the Warre againſt the whole <hi>Tribe,</hi> who devoted to <hi>deſtruction</hi> (by a ſolemn Curſe in <hi>Mizpeh)</hi> what City, Town, or Family ſoever, ſhould not appear to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge this wickedneſſe: Who repented af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that a Tribe ſhould come ſo neer to

was the renown of all the Nations round about, who payd Tribute to <hi>Solomon,</hi> and counted it their glory and happineſs to be his Friends and Allies.</p>
            <p>Adde to this, that during the Reigne of <hi>David, Jeruſalem</hi> firſt came to be ſubject to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> (being formerly in the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Jebuſites,)</hi> which was the only place choſen by God, the Lord of Heaven and Earth, out of all the Earth, to put his name there, here was <hi>Zion</hi> the holy place, out of which the Lord vouchſafed to diſtill his bleſſing, Firſt upon his choſen people, and by their means upon all that fear him, in all Nations, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no difference.

After the Captivity in the time of the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Temple,</hi> the <hi>Jewes</hi> had many changes of <hi>Governours,</hi> and Conditions as is largely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the hiſtory of <hi>Flavius Joſephus,</hi> but flouriſhed under none comparably to <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chichal Government,</hi> and although for a long time, the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> was, and ruled, as their <hi>Prince,</hi> however he changed not the <hi>Kingly Conſtitution</hi> into that of a <hi>Republique,</hi> as Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians will fully ſatisfie any man that deſires information therein, Yea and during the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Temple,</hi> before Chriſt it is certain, that then was their time moſt troubleſome, their Condition moſt lamentable, and to be pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, their diſtractions almoſt ruinous, when the true ſucceſſion from <hi>Shealtiel</hi> to <hi>Zerobabel,</hi> &amp;c. was interrupted, then were they ſold as it were, for a prey to the neighbouring Grecians; and to other enemies, who by frequent incurſions, and in a manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtations of them almoſt ruined them, only now and then God ſent them <hi>Princes,</hi> who were <hi>deliverers</hi> and <hi>famous Captaines,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Machabes</hi> and others, of whom <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To this agrees that the Jewes alwaies did expect the <hi>Meſſaih</hi> to be a <hi>Prince</hi> a great <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> and <hi>deliverer,</hi> and (to uſe the diſciples

            </p>
            <p>Surely Sir, the Proverb is in you veryfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>None ſo blind as he that will not ſee,</hi> (I ſpeak not this of your <hi>Corporall blindneſſe)</hi> for that, (God is my Judge) I pity, but of your bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>eyes,</hi> (viz.) the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> which (me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks) cannot be ſo <hi>palpably blinded,</hi> as you would make appear it is.</p>
            <p>We ſhall eaſily grant you, that Chriſt there ſpeaks of <hi>temporall dominion:</hi> but he ſpeaks to

his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> or rather <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who were his <hi>family</hi> and <hi>houſhold,</hi> who to the very day of his aſſention knew not but that he intended at laſt to appear a <hi>temporall Prince.</hi> Now <hi>Chriſts Kingdome was not of this World,</hi> as he himſelf teſtyfied when he was <hi>betrayed,</hi> if it had been <hi>his ſervants would have fought for him,</hi> thoſe daies of his converſe upon earth were the daies of his <hi>humiliation,</hi> in which his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> though reall was <hi>inviſible,</hi> the Captain of our Salvation, being to be made perfect by ſufferings; So that the check his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples received from him, concerning their ambi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>But as for their ſerving at their own coſts and charge, I wiſh you would be ſo farre a friend to <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> as to make that true; I am ſure, for that lamentable ſervice they did for <hi>God,</hi> in <hi>ſilencing</hi> his <hi>Ministers,</hi> and almoſt <hi>deſtroying</hi> his <hi>Worſhip,</hi> they took from him, whatever for many ages paſt, had been piouſly dedicated to the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his ſervice; and for the never to be forgotten ſervice done to the Nations, they did what they could both to <hi>ruine</hi> and <hi>beggar Majeſty,</hi> undid the <hi>Nobility</hi> and moſt of the <hi>Gentry,</hi> and <hi>ſqueezed</hi> the <hi>Commons,</hi> till they wrung out from them, their <hi>radicall moiſture,</hi> and almoſt their <hi>heart-bloud.</hi> As for their

            <p>But to return to your Scripture, you are not ignorant Sir, I make no queſtion, that many things which Chriſt ſaid to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and which he gave them in Precept, was but for the time, and ſuited to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion, as when he commanded them to go forth without <hi>Proviſion,</hi> of <hi>Clothes, Meat,</hi> or <hi>Money,</hi> or <hi>Staffe,</hi> yet afterwards he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, or rather adviſed them, <hi>That he who had Money, ſhould make uſe of it, and he who had no ſword ſhould ſell his Garment and buy one,</hi> He that expounds that precept of Chriſt, as given to all Chriſtians, and to be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally binding (which was by you cited) I dare promiſe him he ſhall not ſtop at <hi>Kingly Government,</hi> but upon the ſame rule ſhall in fine, <hi>reject</hi> all <hi>Authority.</hi> For at that time Mr. <hi>Milton,</hi> you know, many of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were <hi>governed</hi> by <hi>Republiques,</hi> as to their own Formall conſtitution, although they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and payd a Homage to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire:</hi> Nor was it then out of memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſince the <hi>Romans</hi> were themſelves a <hi>Formall Common-wealth,</hi> the bloudy diſputes

for it againſt <hi>Imperial Monarchy</hi> being ended but a ſmall time before the birth of Chriſt.

But I moſt wonder, that you in your reading did not obſerve, or would not take notice, that this <hi>ambitious ſpirit</hi> of being <hi>greateſt,</hi> was more then <hi>once</hi> the <hi>fault</hi> and <hi>infirmity</hi> of the <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and ſo more then <hi>once</hi> reproved: When Chriſt took a little Childe and ſet amongſt them, and ſaid, <hi>Whoever receiveth not the Kingdome of God as a little Childe, ſhall not enter therein:</hi> That this ſpirit was the ſame of Temporall greatneſſe, is certain, for they had learned, that the <hi>power</hi> of Chriſt, and the <hi>Gifts</hi> by him given to them, were <hi>freely beſtowed,</hi> and ſo they were commanded <hi>freely</hi> to give them: No Divine ever yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that they contended who ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the <hi>gifts of grace,</hi> nor doth Chriſts rebuke imply any ſuch thing, for he propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to them the example of a Childe, free

as long, and was incomparably more glorious; then in its own condition when a <hi>Common-wealth.</hi> As for the <hi>Civil warrs</hi> in the <hi>Empire</hi> that were frequent and bloudy, it muſt be owned, that peace and warre are in the hands of God, by whom <hi>Kings Reign,</hi> and injoy peace or enmity at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.

So a <hi>Dutch Governour,</hi> or <hi>Lord,</hi> when he flounces (as it were) upon a Thier or Murderer, or Coyner of falſe Money, of the like, he makes him to tremble; but, the reſt caſting away fear, will talk irreverently to and ſleightly of their <hi>Heers,</hi> nor make ſcruple to curſe them bitterly, if either they really do diſpleaſe them, or the others ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend cauſe of diſpleaſure.

            <p>But I ſhall leave this, as having I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſpoken to it ſatisfactorily, your next whining complaint againſt <hi>Monarchy</hi> is, that <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> and it are inſeparable. To which an Anſwer is ready, that Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> is groſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſtaken. It is certain, that <hi>Monarchy</hi> is, where <hi>Biſhops</hi> have no place, not are ſo much as known, witneſſe the <hi>Perſian, Tartarian, Turkiſh</hi> and <hi>Indian Monarchies:</hi> and <hi>Biſhops</hi> on the other hand, have been for many years owned, and acknowledged, and to this day are in place and eſteem among thoſe, who are not under <hi>Kings,</hi> witneſſe the <hi>Popiſh Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> the <hi>Venetians, Genoeſes,</hi> and <hi>Hamburghers,</hi> which laſt are a kinde of <hi>Republique,</hi> although they owe and pay Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the King of <hi>Denmark.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which it is evident, that the <hi>Crown</hi> may return, without readmitting the <hi>Mitre,</hi> and it is likely, that <hi>Epiſcopal Lordly</hi> power, will hardly get footing again in the Nation, the <hi>Barons</hi> and other <hi>Nobles</hi> in <hi>Parliament,</hi> (who
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170559:84"/>
were alwayes firm to <hi>Monarchy)</hi> ſtill oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and endeavouring to lift out the <hi>Lords Spiritual,</hi> from having <hi>juriſdiction</hi> among them, as is evident by very many of their <hi>Speeches</hi> to that purpoſe, to this day pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely extant, yea and his <hi>Majeſty</hi> conſented to the diveſting them of all, but their <hi>Title</hi> and <hi>Office,</hi> ſubmitting their <hi>Lordly Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> and <hi>Revenues</hi> to the diſpoſall of the <hi>Parliament.</hi> Concerning whoſe <hi>Office,</hi> and extent of <hi>Power,</hi> it is not now convenient, nor ſeaſonable to argue, and diſpute, nor Wiſdome to determine without Diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; only I ſhall adde, that if <hi>Monarchy</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> were neceſſarily inſeparably link'd, it were a ſtrong argument, for the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of that ſort of <hi>Church Government;</hi> but the contrary is moſt manifeſt, namely, that what Government <hi>Kings</hi> moſt approve, is by them chiefly countenanced, or at leaſt, what the <hi>conſent</hi> of moſt <hi>Divines</hi> under their <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> confirms, as moſt agreeable to <hi>Scripture,</hi> that is permitted, and allowed: So the <hi>Preſbytery</hi> prevailed in <hi>Scotland</hi> to the ruine of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> yet <hi>Kingly Government</hi> was not upon that account rejected by them.</p>
            <p>Adde to this, that moſt of the <hi>Preſbyters</hi> in the Nation, interceded for the <hi>Kings</hi> life,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170559:85"/>
               <hi>proteſted,</hi> and <hi>Remonſtranced</hi> againſt his Death, and the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation, (the moſt ſtrict <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi> reputed) <hi>treated</hi> with, <hi>received,</hi> and <hi>Crowned,</hi> our <hi>Hereditary</hi> now living King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> Son to his murdered Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet readmitted not <hi>Epiſcopacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This only I ſhall ſay, that as a <hi>juſt ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Monarchy,</hi> may be limited, ſo as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt together with the moſt abſolute, and reall true <hi>Freedome</hi> of a flouriſhing State, ſo a <hi>pious</hi> Church overſeeing <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> and a <hi>Godly moderate Preſbytery</hi> are <hi>(res diverſae, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine tantum)</hi> only <hi>nominally</hi> differing, but <hi>really</hi> the ſame: Call the <hi>Biſhop</hi> and the <hi>Preſbyter</hi> by one name, and let the <hi>wiſest, graveſt,</hi> and moſt <hi>Exemplary pious,</hi> be reputed the <hi>Moderator</hi> of the reſt, and let him be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>worthy of double honour,</hi> and have it, and I ſee no remaining reall ground of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity, but that both like Chriſtian Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, may goe hand in hand together, to oppoſe the common Enemies of the <hi>Church,</hi> both <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Sectarian.</hi>

That a great Plague began the Reign of King <hi>James,</hi> and a greater the Reign of his murthered Son <hi>Charles,</hi> in Gods uſual way of dealing with his people, (if it were ſignificant) might argue an Elation of ſpirit in thoſe two <hi>Princes,</hi> in reſpect to the <hi>numerouſneſſe</hi> of the <hi>Subjects</hi> of the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which was lately united to the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem, in King <hi>James</hi> the firſt <hi>Scotch</hi> King that ſwayed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Scepter.

            <p>And thus Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> I have run through your <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> and in anſwering it I have obviated whatever is <hi>material,</hi> in what you wrote againſt <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> either derogating from <hi>Kingly Government,</hi> or juſtifying that <hi>Execrable murder</hi> of our <hi>lawfull,</hi> and once <hi>happy</hi> yet (for ever <hi>glorious) martyr'd King CHARLES;</hi> and in proſecuting my own Aſſertion in oppoſition to yours, I have (I conceive) anticipated any <hi>material</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,

My Lords, and Worthy Senators, you have before you to revive and reſtore, or to kill and deſtroy us, chooſe the former, yea bleſſed be God, you have choſen it and will perform it.
